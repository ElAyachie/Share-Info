# Share Info

## Introduction

### Problem statements 
The stock market can be daunting to newcomers who don't know where to look for information.  With so many different social media and news media outlets it is impossible to take it all in. Existing solutions do a bad job displaying relevant information to the user and giving them an indication of how it correlates to the stock’s performance. This paper proposes a solution that shows the user trending stocks in the stock market and how they correlate with social media and news media.

### Proposed solution 
The purpose of Share Info was to create an online hub for the stock market where users can view online articles and social media posts for stocks and cryptocurrency. We wanted users to view a live feed of congregated information from online spaces like Twitter, Reddit, and the news media. They’d be able to see live market figures and how they correspond to these online spaces. We wanted to allow new users who are interested in but unfamiliar with the stock market to help them get started. With many different sources, users would be able to make their inferences on stocks/crypto that they may or may not want to buy.

### Novelty 
The popular stock trading application Robinhood displays articles to the user that pertain to a stock. To see this information users, have to search for a stock on the application and can scroll down to view information from news articles about the stock. Users can click on these articles to be taken to a page where they can read the article. While Robinhood does a great job displaying news articles about the stock, our application takes in information from news articles and social media posts that talk about the stock. Share Info incorporates information from Twitter and Reddit. Share Info also intends to sort information based on an algorithm designed to try and find the posts or articles that are most relevant.
